# Spring Boot

This sample application was created in order to learn Spring boot.  It was on my personal laptop lost. I found it this weekend while cleaning my dev projects so I decided to share it.

The application is composed of Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.  Also, I added Twitter's bootstrap for style and look + feel.

The project uses gradle for dependency and build management.

## TODO's
- [] deploy to Heroku App with Gradle.
