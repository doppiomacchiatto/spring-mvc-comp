# Spring Boot

This sample application was created in order to learn Spring boot.  It was on mypersonal laptop lost and now that I found it, I am sharing it.

The application is composed of Spring MVC, Spring Security and Spring Boot.  Also, I added Twitter's bootstrap for style and slick look and feel.

The project use gradle for dependency and build management.  Maven was good but gradle is better.

## TODO's
- [] deploy to Heroku App with Gradle.
